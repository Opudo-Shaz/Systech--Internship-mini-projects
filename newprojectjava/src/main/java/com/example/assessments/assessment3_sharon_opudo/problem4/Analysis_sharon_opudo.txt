Issue 1: Incorrect assignment in the setSalary method

The statement salary = salary; assigns the method parameter to itself instead of updating the instance variable. As a result, the employee’s salary is never stored in the object.

Fix:
Use the this keyword to refer to the instance variable and correctly assign the value.


Issue 2: Invalid salary values are not properly handled

When a negative salary is provided, the program only prints an error message but still allows the method to continue executing. This can lead to incorrect salary values being stored.

Fix:
Terminate the method execution when an invalid salary is detected by using a return statement, preventing the assignment from taking place.

Issue 3: Incorrect return type in the calculateBonus method

The method calculateBonus is declared with a void return type but attempts to return a value. This causes an error because a void method cannot return data.

Fix:
Change the method return type to double so that it can correctly return the calculated bonus value.

Issue 4: Static variable companyName is not initialized

The static variable companyName is declared but never given a value. This can lead to unexpected null values when the variable is accessed.

Fix:
Initialize the static variable at the point of declaration or provide a setter method to assign its value before use.
